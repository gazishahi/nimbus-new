## üì± Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd nimbus-fitness
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Grant Permissions**
   - Allow location permissions when prompted
   - For best results, use the app outdoors with good GPS signal

## üîß HealthKit Integration

This version includes a simulated HealthKit integration. For full HealthKit integration on iOS:

1. Add the HealthKit dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install @kingstinct/react-native-healthkit
   ```

2. Update app.json with HealthKit permissions:
   ```json
   {
     "ios": {
       "infoPlist": {
         "UIBackgroundModes": ["healthkit"],
         "NSHealthShareUsageDescription": "Nimbus Fitness uses HealthKit to track your workouts and save your fitness data.",
         "NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription": "Nimbus Fitness saves your workout data to HealthKit for a comprehensive view of your fitness."
       },
       "entitlements": {
         "com.apple.developer.healthkit": true,
         "com.apple.developer.healthkit.background-delivery": true
       }
     },
     "plugins": [
       [
         "@kingstinct/react-native-healthkit",
         {
           "NSHealthShareUsageDescription": "Nimbus Fitness uses HealthKit to track your workouts and save your fitness data.",
           "NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription": "Nimbus Fitness saves your workout data to HealthKit for a comprehensive view of your fitness.",
           "background": true
         }
       ]
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Create a development build:
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

## üèó Architecture

### Service Layer
- **WorkoutService**: Singleton pattern for managing workout state
- **HealthKitService**: Handles HealthKit integration (simulated in this version)
- **Location-based tracking**: Uses expo-location for accurate GPS tracking

### UI Components
- **Modular design**: Separate components for workout types, metrics, and controls
- **Pixel art styling**: Consistent with app's retro aesthetic
- **Real-time updates**: Automatic UI refresh during workouts

### State Management
- **React hooks**: Custom hooks for workout integration
- **Local state**: Component-level state for UI interactions
- **Event propagation**: Workout events bubble up through listeners

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Workout Tracking
```tsx
import { useWorkout } from '@/hooks/useWorkout';
import WorkoutMetrics from '@/components/WorkoutMetrics';

function MyComponent() {
  const { currentSession, isActive, startWorkout, endWorkout } = useWorkout();
  
  return (
    <View>
      {isActive && currentSession && (
        <WorkoutMetrics 
          metrics={currentSession.metrics}
          isActive={isActive}
          isPaused={false}
        />
      )}
      <Button 
        title={isActive ? "End Workout" : "Start Workout"} 
        onPress={isActive ? endWorkout : () => startWorkout('outdoor_run')}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## üîí Privacy & Permissions

- **Location permissions**: Required for accurate distance and speed tracking
- **HealthKit permissions**: Optional, for saving workout data to Apple Health
- **Minimal data collection**: Only tracks what's necessary for workout functionality
- **Local processing**: All calculations happen on-device

## üß™ Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Permission Flow**: Test location permission granting
2. **Workout Tracking**: Start, pause, resume, and end workouts
3. **Real-time Data**: Verify metrics update during active workouts
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with poor GPS connectivity, background operation, etc.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Location permission required"**
   - Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Nimbus Fitness
   - Enable location access

2. **"Inaccurate distance tracking"**
   - Ensure you have a clear view of the sky for better GPS signal
   - Wait a few seconds after starting a workout for GPS to stabilize

3. **"Workout not saving"**
   - Workouts under 3 minutes are not saved by design
   - Check your internet connection for database saving
